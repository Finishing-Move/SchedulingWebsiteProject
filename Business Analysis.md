# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept

### a) operational policies and constraints;
Only techs shall be able to edit and make changes to the appointments list of the website.

Constraints:
* Only certain amounts of people can make appointments on a certain day
* The website should not reveal the information of the customer that appointed that time to other customers
* Only operators using the system shall be able to edit with the appointments list
### b) description of the proposed system;
The website shall allow customers to schedule an appointment at a certain time for certain date. Customers are able to pick which tech they want to be appointed with or able to choose a random tech. The website should make it so timezones that are appointed for are unable to be chosen so overbooking doesn't happen.

### c) modes of system operation;
* Regular mode of system operation should allow customers to set up appointments and operators are able to edit the appointments list.
* Maintenance mode of system operation should temporarily close the website down for a set amount of time decided by the maintainers/operators. At this time, customers will have to use the call method or walk in appointments.

### d) user classes and other involved personnel; and
User classes include:
* Customer
* Operators
* Maintainers
### e) support environment.

### 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
1.) Customer to System - The customer shall be able to schedule an appointment at a certain time on the website.
2.) Operators viewing the system - The operators shall be able to view upcoming appointments. 
2.) Operators using the system - Operators shall be able to edit appointments to either delete them or move them into a finished appointment. 

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
System solutions should be required by discussing with the primary stakeholders on what they want and what they need out of this solution. Discussion shall include topics of:
* Requirements needed for the website
* How they want the website to look like, including theme, design, and overall aesthetic
* Many website prototypes will be distributed out to the stakeholders to try and provide and critics


## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
Prototypes for the website shall be provided with the client for demonstration to see if the client approves of the current model and if not, make note of any changes needed.

The solution system shall be delivered by introducing customers to the product and suggesting them to use it.

## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
Maintenance support is the main support needed for this project. The maintainers frequently have to maintain and update the website to optimize/secure it and keep it up to date.

## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
This solution, once down with it's lifespan, shall be retired when the establishment decides to replace it with a new service. The operation should stop using the website and redirect customers to the new service. The retired website should have an announcement about when the website shall be retired.

# 7. Project Constraints
The project shall be able to run on most devices such as phones, computers, and tablets.
